This repository contains a JavaScript project designed to interact with the SimpleStorage smart contract on the Ethereum network, leveraging the web3.js library. It demonstrates how to establish a connection to Ethereum, enabling users to call the contract's `store` and `retrieve` functions directly from a web page. The codebase includes specific functions for configuring the web3 connection and for managing user interactions seamlessly. This project serves as a practical example of web3.js applications, providing a simple interface for storing and retrieving data on the blockchain.
